 
  To get started on a new problem do the following
  
  1. Import  Input and Target data from the workspace with [IMPORT].
  2. Create a new Network with [NEW].
  3. Select the network in the Network list and click [OPEN]
  4. Select the training tab in the Network Window.
  5. Select training input and target data, and click [TRAIN].
  6. You can also use the Network Window to simulate the network, or
      perform other tasks such as reinitialization and editing of weights.
  
  Here are descriptions of each button
  
  [IMPORT] - Imports data and networks from the workspace or a file.
  [NEW] - Allows you to create a network or data within a dialog.
  [OPEN] - Opens the selected data or network for viewing and editing.
  [EXPORT] - Exports data and networks to the workspace or a file.
  [DELETE] - Removes the selected data or network.
  [HELP] - Opens this window.
  
  Here are descriptions of each list
  
  Networks - List of networks.
  Inputs - Data to present to a network.
  Targets - Data defining the desired network outputs.
  Outputs - Response of a network to its inputs.
  Errors - Difference between targets and outputs.
  Input Delays - Input delay states for networks with input delays.
  Layer Delays - Layer delay states for networks with layer delays.
